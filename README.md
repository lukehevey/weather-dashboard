# Weather Dashboard


## Description
The purpose of this assignment was to create an application that shows current weather and a five day forecast of the city that is searched. The langauages used for this application were HTML, CSS, and mostly JavaScript. The challanges with this assignment was trying to get all the APIs to work and show all of the data. This assignment helped me learn a lot and I will continue to improve the application as I learn more.
